MediaWiki extension: CirrusSearch
-------------------------------


Installation
------------
Fetch both this plugin and the Solarium plugin into your extensions directory.
Make sure you have the curl php library installed (sudo apt-get install php5-curl in Debian.)
Add this to LocalSettings.php:
 require_once( "$IP/extensions/Solarium/Solarium.php");
 require_once( "$IP/extensions/CirrusSearch/CirrusSearch.php" );
 $wgCirrusSearchUpdateInProcess = false;

Now run this script to generate your Solr config:
 php maintenance/buildSolrConfig.php

Now start solr with that config.  Once it is working remove $wgCirrusSearchUpdateInProcess = false 
from LocalSettings.php.  Updates should start heading to Solr.  Check on that and make sure they
are working.

Next bootstrap the search index by running:
 php maintenance/forceSolrIndex.php

Finally add this to LocalSettings.php to funnel queries to Solr:
$wgSearchType = 'CirrusSearch';


Bootstrapping large wikis
-------------------------
forceSolrIndex.php accepts the --fromId and --toId parameters which can be used to split up the
work of bootstrapping the wiki into multiple processes.  Most of the load caused by bootstrapping
is on MySQL but if you've got a really big database or a few slaves then they should be able to
handle a whole bunch of bootstraps at once.

Also, the --batch-size parameter controls the number documents read from MySQL and inserted into
Solr at one time.  It defaults to 500 because that seems to give good performence (~100 articles
per second) in development but you should feel free to play with it.


Handling solr outages
---------------------
If for some reason in process updates to Solr begin failing you can immediately
set "$wgCirrusSearchUpdateInProcess = false;" in your LocalSettings.php file to
stop trying to update solr.  Once you figure out what is wrong with Solr you
should turn those updates back on and then run the following:
php maintenance/forceSolrIndex.php --from <whenever the outage started in ISO 8601 format> --deletes
php maintenance/forceSolrIndex.php --from <whenever the outage started in ISO 8601 format>

The first command picks up all the deletes that occurred during the outage and
should complete quite quickly.  The second command picks up all the updates
that occurred during the outage and might take significantly longer.
