Features
--------
* Handle "List Redirects"
* Don't turn on our prefix search unless our normal search is on so we don't break prefix search
while bootstrapping the index.

Admin
-----
* Very very safe batch scripts arround creating and deleting and updating shards.
* (Ops via RT) Bundle up solr cloud so it can be installed nicely and without collection1.
* Figure out a good way to update the index without blowing it away and rebuilding it.
** There is a bug that'll be fixed in 4.4 that prevents the RELOAD command.
** We can work around the bug by using rolling restarts.
* Figure out a good way to update the solr config remotely.
* Monitoring and metrics
** jmxtrans looks like it should be good for metrics

Maybe Do
--------
* Transform foo* and *foo queries into prefix and suffix search queries.  This is only required if
these queries are both common and slow.
* Context free synonym checking.
** Scoring this appropriately will be interesting.
* Strip out things like maintenance templates before parsing--the "citation needed" problem.
See comment in CirrusSearch::getTextFromContent()


Stuff we should try not to do
-----------------------------
* Search fuzzily â€“ Spelling relaxation occurs by suffixing a tilde (~) like this~, with results like
"thus" and "thins". For example, searching for james~ watt~ would return James Watt, James Wyatt, and
James Watts. A mnemonic: <search>-ish.
** The "james~ watt~"" query appears every once in a while beyond that this feature doesn't look like
it is used much.
* Stemming may be deactivated by using double quotes.
