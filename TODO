Features
--------
* (Chad) Move updates to after page render.
* Figure out why the first letter in a search is capitalized and stop it.
* Handle offsets in Solr rather than MediaWiki. Only search what you need.
* In the text field index only text - not all the wikitext.
* Escape the query terms properly.  urlescaping them is wrong because they get urlescaped later which
causes searchs for non-ascii characters to fail spectacularly.  Not escaping them at all feels wrong.
* Handle html &ecric; style encoding - it should be searchable by regular e.
* We should also be squashing accents for some languages.
* (Nik looking into which of these is actually used) enwiki has the following in Help:Searching that
I don't think we support now but probably should at least consider:
** Entering an article title will jump to that article; to display a list of matches to the search
term instead, prefixing the search term with "-" or "~" (see "Avoiding automatic direction to page"
below) will force a full search.
** Wildcard search – A wildcard character *, standing for any length of character-string can prefix or
suffix a word or string: *like will return "childlike" and "dream-like"; this*, returns results like
"thistle". For example, the query *stan lists articles like Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.
** Search fuzzily – Spelling relaxation occurs by suffixing a tilde (~) like this~, with results like
"thus" and "thins". For example, searching for james~ watt~ would return James Watt, James Wyatt, and
James Watts. A mnemonic: <search>-ish.
** Search results! – Prefixing a tilde ~like this query always gives search results, never jumping to
a single title. It functions as the keyboard shortcut to clicking on the "containing" option. For
example, ~similiar finds pages with the misspelling, instead of being redirected to Similarity. Making
tilde the first character disables a redirect. There will be no disambiguation page, no article, no
single page as a result. A mnemonic: "wave of <search results>"
** The entire Parameters section.
** Stemming may be deactivated by using double quotes.



Admin
-----
* Very very safe batch scripts arround creating and deleting and updating shards.
* (Ops via RT) Bundle up solr cloud so it can be installed nicely and without collection1.
* Figure out a good way to update the index without blowing it away and rebuilding it.
** There is a bug that'll be fixed in 4.4 that prevents the RELOAD command.
** We can work around the bug by using rolling restarts.
* Figure out a good way to update the solr config remotely.
