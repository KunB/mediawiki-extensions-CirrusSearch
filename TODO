Features
--------
* Handle "List Redirects"
* Speed up batch search updates.
* Give ElasticSearch a shot.
* Search redirects to a page somehow.
** Currently it looks like they are indexed as a separate field with highlighting, etc.


Admin
-----
* Very very safe batch scripts arround creating and deleting and updating shards.
* (Ops via RT) Bundle up solr cloud so it can be installed nicely and without collection1.
* Figure out a good way to update the index without blowing it away and rebuilding it.
** There is a bug that'll be fixed in 4.4 that prevents the RELOAD command.
** We can work around the bug by using rolling restarts.
* Figure out a good way to update the solr config remotely.
* Monitoring and metrics
** jmxtrans looks like it should be good for metrics
* Forcing some admin requests to solr to only work from localhost
** This can be done reasonably simply with web.xml configuration that we package with solr.

Maybe Do
--------
* Transform foo* and *foo queries into prefix and suffix search queries.  This is only required if
these queries are both common and slow.
* Context free synonym checking.
** Scoring this appropriately will be interesting.
* Strip out things like maintenance templates before parsing--the "citation needed" problem.
See comment in CirrusSearch::getTextFromContent()
* Edits to transcluded pages trigger reindexes in the pages in which they are included
