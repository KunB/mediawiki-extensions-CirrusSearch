Generate the config.
	Generate the config with the correct language.
	Add caching configuration.
	Spell check configuration.
Figure out a good way to update the solr config remotely.
Move updates to after page render.
What do we do about wikidata and its json?
Deletes both in batch and online
	Must be skippable in batch
	Must handle revision deletes (for oversighted articles)
Do we need to bootstrap artciles without revisions?
	These cases happen but probably don't matter: we have revisions that don't articles and we have missing revisions.
Optimizations of batch loading (we'll need about 2000 pages/second to bootstrap enwiki in 10 days)
Should prefix search be dismax with weights or just default?  Maybe we should sort the length of the thing that is matched?
Handle offsets in Solr rather than MediaWiki. Only search what you need.


Things to test:
User pages
Unicode
Non-English Language


Notes on redirects:
	Looks like we don't index the redirects.  We should probably make that explicit.
	I added support to index the titles of all pages that redirect to a page.  The results look funny but it works pretty well.
	We really need to make a better weight/sorting for prefix search.
