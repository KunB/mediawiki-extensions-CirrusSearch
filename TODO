Features
--------
* (Chad) Move updates to after page render.
* Figure out why the first letter in a search is capitalized and stop it.
* Handle offsets in Solr rather than MediaWiki. Only search what you need.
* Search results! – Prefixing a tilde ~like this query always gives search results, never jumping to
a single title. It functions as the keyboard shortcut to clicking on the "containing" option. For
example, ~similiar finds pages with the misspelling, instead of being redirected to Similarity. Making
tilde the first character disables a redirect. There will be no disambiguation page, no article, no
single page as a result. A mnemonic: "wave of <search results>"
** This is absolutely used but really ought to be handled inside MediaWiki's core rather than as a
search plugin.
* intitle:


Admin
-----
* Very very safe batch scripts arround creating and deleting and updating shards.
* (Ops via RT) Bundle up solr cloud so it can be installed nicely and without collection1.
* Figure out a good way to update the index without blowing it away and rebuilding it.
** There is a bug that'll be fixed in 4.4 that prevents the RELOAD command.
** We can work around the bug by using rolling restarts.
* Figure out a good way to update the solr config remotely.
* Monitoring and metrics
** jmxtrans looks like it should be good for this.


Stuff we should try not to do
-----------------------------
* Wildcard search – A wildcard character *, standing for any length of character-string can prefix or
suffix a word or string: *like will return "childlike" and "dream-like"; this*, returns results like
"thistle". For example, the query *stan lists articles like Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.
** This could be done with a combination of prefix and suffix n-grams but that'll take up a bunch of
space.
** I _think_ this is used sometimes but in more cases people just seem to be adding * to searches for
fun rather than when they mean to.
* Search fuzzily – Spelling relaxation occurs by suffixing a tilde (~) like this~, with results like
"thus" and "thins". For example, searching for james~ watt~ would return James Watt, James Wyatt, and
James Watts. A mnemonic: <search>-ish.
** The "james~ watt~"" query appears every once in a while beyond that this feature doesn't look like
it is used much.
* Stemming may be deactivated by using double quotes.
